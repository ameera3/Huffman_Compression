# Huffman_Compression

## Usage
To compile, type "make". To run the program, type "./huffman huffman.txt"

## Introduction
The command line program huffman.cpp takes in one parameter, 
an input file name. The input file specified by the input
file name should contain the number of symbols and their
weights in the format:
 
[number of symbols]

[weight of symbol 1]

[weight of symbol 2]
               
...
 
The program runs the Huffman compression algorithm and 
outputs the maximum and minimum lengths of codewords.
